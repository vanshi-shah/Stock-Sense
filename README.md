# StockSense

Build a modular Inventory Management System (IMS) that digitizes and streamlines all stock-related operations within a business. The goal is to replace manual registers, Excel sheets, and scattered tracking methods with a centralized, real-time, easy-to-use app.

## Target Users
- **Inventory Managers** – manage incoming & outgoing stock.
- **Warehouse Staff** – perform transfers, picking, shelving, and counting.

## Authentication
- The user signs up/logs in.
- OTP-based password reset.
- Redirected to Inventory Dashboard.

## Dashboard View
The landing page shows a snapshot of inventory operations.

**Dashboard KPIs**
- Total Products in Stock
- Low Stock / Out of Stock Items
- Pending Receipts
- Pending Deliveries
- Internal Transfers Scheduled

**Dynamic Filters**
- By document type: Receipts / Delivery / Internal / Adjustments
- By status: Draft, Waiting, Ready, Done, Canceled
- By warehouse or location
- By product category

## Navigation
1. **Products**
   - Create/update products.
   - Stock availability per location.

   - Reordering rules.
2. **Operations**
   1. Receipts (Incoming Stock)
   2. Delivery Orders (Outgoing Stock)

## Core Features

### 1. Product Management
- Create products with:
  - Name
  - SKU / Code
  - Category
  - Unit of Measure
  - Initial stock (optional)

### 2. Receipts (Incoming Goods)
Used when items arrive from vendors.
**Process:**
1. Create a new receipt.
2. Add supplier & products.
3. Input quantities received.
4. Validate → stock increases automatically.

*Example:* Receive 50 units of "Steel Rods" → stock +50.

### 3. Delivery Orders (Outgoing Goods)
Used when stock leaves the warehouse for customer shipment.
**Process:**
1. Pick items.
2. Pack items.
3. Validate → stock decreases automatically.

*Example:* Sales order for 10 chairs → Delivery order reduces chairs by 10.

### 4. Internal Transfers
Move stock inside the company:
*Example:*
- Main Warehouse → Production Floor
- Rack A → Rack B
- Warehouse 1 → Warehouse 2

Each movement is logged in the ledger.

### 5. Stock Adjustments
Fix mismatches between:
1. Recorded stock
2. Physical count

**Steps:**
- Select product/location
- Enter counted quantity
- System auto-updates and logs the adjustment
